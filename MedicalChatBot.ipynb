In the United States, heart disease is the #1\\nkiller of both women and men. It affects many people at midlife, as well as in old age. It also can happen to those who “feel fine.”Consider these facts: \\n■Each year, 500,000 Americans die of heart disease, and approx-imately half of them are women.\\n■As early as age 45, a man’s risk of heart disease begins to rise significantly. For a woman, risk starts to increase at age 55.\\n■Fifty percent of men and 64 percent of women who die suddenlyof heart disease have no previous symptoms of the disease.1Heart Disease: Why Should You Care?Heart Disease:\\nWhy Should You Care?\\n'),\n",

The good\\nnews is that you have a lot of power to protect and improve yourheart health. This guidebook will help you find out your own riskof heart disease and take steps to prevent it.\\n“But,” you may still be thinking, “I take pretty good care of myself.\\nI’m unlikely to get heart disease.” Yet a recent national survey showsthat only 3 percent of U.S. adults practice all of the “Big Four”habits that help to prevent heart disease: eating a healthy diet, getting regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, andavoiding smoking. Many young people are also vulnerable. Arecent study showed that about two-thirds of teenagers already haveat least one risk factor for heart disease.\\nEvery risk factor counts. Research shows that each individual risk\\nfactor greatly increases the chances of developing heart disease.Moreover, the worse a particular risk factor is, the more likely youare to develop heart disease. For example, if you have high bloodpressure, the higher it is, the greater your chances of developingheart disease, including its many serious consequences. A damagedheart can damage your life by interfering with enjoyable activities,preventing you from holding a job, and even keeping you fromdoing simple things, such as taking a walk or climbing steps.\\nWhat can you do to reduce your personal risk of heart disease?\\nFirst, you can learn about your own risk factors. Second, you canbegin to make healthful changes in your diet, physical activity, andother daily habits. Whatever your age or current state of health, it’snever too late to take steps to protect your heart. It’s also never tooearly. The sooner you act, the better.

Plaque is the accumulation of fat, cholesterol, and othersubstances. As plaque continues to build up in the arteries, bloodflow to the heart is reduced.\\nHeart disease can lead to a heart attack. A heart attack happens\\nwhen an artery becomes totally blocked with plaque, preventingvital oxygen and nutrients from getting to the heart. A heart attackcan cause permanent damage to the heart muscle.\\nHeart disease is one of several cardiovascular diseases, which are\\ndisorders of the heart and blood vessel system. Other cardiovasculardiseases include stroke, high blood pressure, and rheumatic heartdisease.\\nSome people aren’t too concerned about heart disease because they\\nthink it can be “cured” with surgery. This is a myth.\\nHeart disease is a lifelong condition: Once you get it,\\nyou’ll always have it. It’s true that procedures such as\\nangioplasty and bypass surgery can help blood and\\noxygen flow more easily to the heart. But the arter-\\nies remain damaged, which means you are still more\\nlikely to have a heart attack.

They can also increase the chances that anexisting disease will get worse. Important risk factors for heart dis-ease that you can do something about are cigarette smoking, highblood pressure, high blood cholesterol, overweight, physical inactivity, and diabetes. Recent research shows that more than 95 percent of those who die from heart disease have at least one of these major risk factors.\\nCertain risk factors, such as getting older, can’t be changed. After\\nmenopause, women are more likely to develop heart disease. Forboth women and men, middle age is a time of increasing riskbecause people are more likely to develop heart disease risk factorsduring this stage of life.\\nFamily history of early heart disease is another risk factor that can’t\\nbe changed. If your father or brother had a heart attack before age55, or if your mother or sister had one before age 65, you are morelikely to get heart disease.\\nWhile certain risk factors cannot be changed, it is important to \\nrealize that you dohave control over many others. Regardless of\\nyour age or family history, you can take important steps to loweryour risk of heart disease.\\nHow Risk Works\\nIt may be tempting to believe that doing just one healthy thing willtake care of your heart disease risk. For example, you may hopethat if you walk or swim regularly, you can still eat a lot of fattyfoods and stay fairly healthy. Not true. To protect your heart, it isvital to make changes that address each and every risk factor youhave. You can make the changes gradually, one at a time. But mak-ing them is very important.\\nWhile each risk factor increases your risk of heart disease, having\\nmore than one risk factor is especially serious. That’s because riskfactors tend to “gang up” and worsen each other’s effects. Forexample, if you have high blood cholesterol and you smoke, yourheart disease risk increases enormously.

What follows is a guide to the most important risk factorsfor heart disease and how each of them affects your health.\\nSmoking\\nSmoking is “the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States,” according to the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention (CDC). People who smoke are up to six times morelikely to suffer a heart attack than nonsmokers, and the risk increas-es with the number of cigarettes smoked each day. Smoking can also shorten a healthy life, because smokers are likely to suffer aheart attack or other major heart problem at least 10 years soonerthan nonsmokers.\\nBut heart disease is far from the only health risk faced by smokers.\\nSmoking also raises the risk of stroke and greatly increases thechances of developing lung cancer. Smoking is also linked withmany other types of cancer, including cancers of the mouth, urinarytract, kidney, and cervix. Smoking also causes most cases of chronicobstructive lung disease, which includes bronchitis and emphysema.If you live or work with others, your secondhand smoke can causenumerous health problems in those individuals. A recent studyshows a 60-percent increased risk of heart disease for nonsmokerswho are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke.\\nCurrently, 25 percent of American men and 20 percent of American\\nwomen are smokers. Even more disturbing, 26 percent of highschool seniors smoke. In young people, smoking can interfere withlung growth and cause more frequent and severe respiratory illnesses,in addition to heart disease and cancer risks.

Low-tar and low-nicotine \\ncigarettes do not lessen the risks of heart disease or other smoking-related diseases. The only safe and healthful course is not to smoke atall. (For tips on quitting, see “You CanStop Smoking” on page 76.) \\nHigh Blood Pressure  \\nHigh blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is another major\\nrisk factor for heart disease, as well as for kidney disease and con-gestive heart failure. High blood pressure is also the most importantrisk factor for stroke. Even slightly high blood pressure levelsincrease your risk for these conditions.\\nNew research shows that at least 65 million adults in the United\\nStates have high blood pressure—a 30-percent increase over the lastseveral years. Equally worrisome, blood pressure levels haveincreased substantially for American children and teens, whichincreases their risk of developing hypertension in adulthood.\\nMajor contributors to high blood pressure are a family history of\\nthe disease, overweight, and dietary salt. Older individuals are athigher risk than younger people. Among older individuals, womenare more likely than men to develop high blood pressure. AfricanAmericans are more likely to develop high blood pressure, and atearlier ages, than Whites. But nearly all of us are at risk, especiallyas we grow older. Middle-aged Americans who don’t currently have high blood pressure have a 90-percent chance of eventuallydeveloping the disease.\\nHigh blood pressure is often called the silent killer because it \\nusually doesn’t cause symptoms. As a result, many people pay littleattention to their blood pressure until they become seriously ill.According to a national survey, two-thirds of people with high blood pressure do not have it under control. The good news is thatyou can take action to control or prevent high blood pressure, andthereby avoid many life-threatening disorders. A new blood pres-sure category, called prehypertension, has been created to alert peo-ple to their increased risk of developing high blood pressure so thatthey can take steps to prevent the disease.Your Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Everyone has to have some blood pressure,so that blood can get to all of the body’s organs. Usually, bloodpressure is expressed as two numbers, such as 120/80, and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The first number is the systolic blood pressure, the amount of force used when the heart beats. The second number, or diastolic blood pressure, is thepressure that exists in the arteries between heartbeats.\\nBecause blood pressure changes often, your health care provider\\nshould check it on several different days before deciding whether it istoo high. Blood pressure is considered “high” when it stays aboveprehypertensive levels over a period of time. (See accompanying box.)13Major Risk FactorsYour Blood Pressure:\\nCrunching the Numbers\\nYour blood pressure category is determined by the higher \\nnumber of either your systolic or your diastolic measurement.\\nFor example, if your systolic number is 115 but your diastolicnumber is 85, your category is prehypertension. \\nSystolic Diastolic\\nNormal blood pressure Less than  and Less than\\n120 mmHg 80 mmHg\\nPrehypertension 120–139      or 80–89 mmHg\\nmmHg\\nHigh blood pressure 140 mmHg or 90 mmHg\\nor higher or higher\\nBlood Pressure'),\n",

But many people don’t realize that the second category—prehypertension—also increases your risk of heartattack, stroke, and heart failure. To the extent possible, everyoneshould aim for normal blood pressure levels.\\nBe aware, too, that a high systolic blood pressure level (first number)\\nis dangerous. If your systolic blood pressure is 140 mmHg or high-er, you are more likely to develop cardiovascular and kidney diseaseseven if your diastolic blood pressure (second number) is in the normal range. After age 50, people are more likely to develop highsystolic blood pressure. High systolic blood pressure is high bloodpressure. If you have this condition, you will need to take steps tocontrol it. High blood pressure can be controlled in two ways:  bychanging your lifestyle and by taking medication.\\nChanging Your Lifestyle\\nIf your blood pressure is not too high, you may be able to control it entirely by losing weight if you are overweight, getting regularphysical activity, cutting down on alcohol, and changing your eatinghabits. A special eating plan called DASH can help you lower yourblood pressure. DASH stands for “Dietary Approaches to StopHypertension.”  The DASH eating plan emphasizes fruits, vegeta-bles, whole-grain foods, and low-fat or fat-free milk and milk products.It is rich in magnesium, potassium, and calcium, as well as proteinand fiber. It is low in saturated and total fat and cholesterol, andlimits red meat, sweets, and beverages with added sugars.\\nIf you follow the DASH eating plan and also consume less sodium,\\nyou are likely to reduce your blood pressure even more. Sodium is asubstance that affects blood pressure. It is the main ingredient insalt and is found in many processed foods, such as soups, conven-ience meals, some breads and cereals, and salted snacks.\\nFor more on the DASH eating plan and other changes you can make\\nto lower and prevent high blood pressure, see the “Taking Charge”section of this guidebook (pages 45–82.)Your Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Cholesterol\\nlowering is i mportant for everyone—women and men; younger, \\nmiddle-aged, and older adults; and people with and without heartdisease.\\nCholesterol and Your Heart\\nThe body needs cholesterol to function normally. However, yourbody makes all the cholesterol it needs. Over a period of years,extra cholesterol and fat circulating in the blood build up in thewalls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This buildup,called plaque, makes the arteries narrower and narrower. As aresult, less blood gets to the heart. Blood carries oxygen to theheart; if enough oxygen-rich blood cannot reach your heart, youmay suffer chest pain. If the blood supply to a portion of the heartis completely cut off, the result is a heart attack.\\nCholesterol travels in the blood in packages called lipoproteins.\\nLDL carries most of the cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol pack-aged in LDL is often called bad cholesterol, because too high a levelof LDL in your blood can lead to cholesterol buildup and blockagein your arteries.\\nAnother type of cholesterol is HDL, also called good cholesterol.\\nThat’s because HDL helps remove cholesterol from the body, preventing it from building up in your arteries.17Major Risk Factors'),\n",

You may be prescribed just onecholesterol-lowering drug, or two in combination. Following arethe most commonly used medicines:\\nStatins. These are the most commonly prescribed drugs for\\npeople who need a cholesterol-lowering medicine. Of all avail-able medications, statins lower LDL cholesterol the most, usuallyby 20 to 60 percent. Side effects are usually mild, although liverand muscle problems occur rarely. If you experience muscleaches or weakness, contact your doctor promptly.  \\nBile acid sequestrants. These medications lower LDL cholesterol\\nby about 10 to 20 percent. Bile acid sequestrants are often prescribed along with a statin to further decrease LDL cholesterol levels. Side effects may include constipation, bloating, nausea, andgas. However, long-term use of these medicines is considered safe. \\nNiacin. Niacin, or nicotinic acid, lowers total cholesterol, LDL\\ncholesterol, and triglyceride levels, while also raising HDL cholesterol. Niacin is available without a prescription, but it isimportant to use it only under a doctor’s care because of possi-ble serious side effects. In some people, it may worsen pepticulcers or cause liver problems, gout, or high blood sugar. \\nFibrates. These drugs can reduce triglycerides levels by 20 to\\n50 percent, while increasing HDL cholesterol by 10 to 15 percent.Fibrates are not very effective for lowering LDL cholesterol. Thedrugs can increase the chances of developing gallstones andheighten the effects of blood-thinning drugs. \\nEzetimibe. This is the first in a new class of cholesterol-\\nlowering drugs that interfere with the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine. It can be used alone or in combination with astatin. Side effects may include back and joint pain. '),\n",

One important treatment approach is called TLC,\\nwhich stands for “Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes.”  This treatment includes a low saturated fat and low-cholesterol diet, regular moderate-intensity physical activity, and weight manage-ment. Everyone who needs to lower their LDL cholesterol shoulduse this TLC program. (For more information, see “Give YourHeart a Little TLC” on page 55.) Maintaining a healthy weight andgetting regular physical activity are especially important for thosewho have metabolic syndrome.\\nMedication . If your LDL level stays too high even after making\\nlifestyle changes, you may need to take medicine. If you need med-ication, be sure to use it along with the TLC approach. This willkeep the dose of medicine as low as possible, and will lower yourrisk in other ways as well. You will also need to control all of yourother heart disease risk factors, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking.\\nOverweight and Obesity\\nA healthy weight is important for a long, vigorous life. Yet over-weight and obesity (extreme overweight) have reached epidemic levels in the United States. Today, nearly two-thirds of Americanadults are overweight or obese. Groups at highest risk for obesityinclude African American women, Mexican Americans, andAmerican Indians, but millions of people from all backgroundsweigh more than is healthy for them. Since 1991, the proportion of Americans who are obese has soared by 75 percent.\\nOverweight among children is also swiftly increasing. Among young\\npeople ages 6–19, more than 16 percent are overweight, comparedto just 4 percent a few decades ago. This is a disturbing trendbecause overweight adolescents have a greatly increased risk ofdying from heart disease in adulthood. Even our youngest citizensare at risk. About 10 percent of preschoolers weigh more than ishealthy for them.\\nOur national waistline is expanding for two simple reasons—we are\\neating more and moving less. Americans consume about 200–300more calories per day than they did in the 1970s. Moreover, as wespend more time in front of computers, video games, TV, and otherelectronic pastimes, we have fewer hours available for physical activity.24Your Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

If you are\\noverweight, you are more likely to develop heart disease even if youhave no other risk factors. The more overweight a person is, themore likely he or she is to develop heart disease. Overweight andobesity also increase the risks for diabetes, high blood pressure, highcholesterol, stroke, congestive heart failure, gallbladder disease,arthritis, breathing problems, and gout, as well as cancers of thebreast and colon. Each year, an estimated 300,000 U.S. adults die of diseases related to obesity. The bottom line:  Maintaining ahealthy weight is a vital part of preventing heart disease and protecting overall health.\\nShould You Choose To Lose? \\nDo you need to lose weight to reduce your risk of heart disease?You can find out by taking three simple steps.\\nStep 1: Get your number. Take a look at the box on the next page.\\nYou’ll see that your weight in relation to your height gives you anumber called a Body Mass Index (BMI). A BMI from 18.5 to 24.9indicates a normal weight. A person with a BMI from 25 to 29.9 isoverweight, while someone with a BMI of 30 or higher is obese.Those in the overweight and obese categories have a higher risk ofheart disease—and the higher the BMI, the greater the risk.\\nStep 2: Take out a tape measure . The second step is to take your\\nwaist measurement. For women, a waist measurement of over 35inches increases the risk of heart disease as well as the risks of highblood pressure, diabetes, and other serious health conditions. Formen, a waist measurement of more than 40 inches increases theserisks. To measure your waist correctly, stand and place a tape meas-ure around your middle, just above your hipbones. Measure yourwaist just after you breathe out.\\nStep 3: Review your risk. The final step in determining your need to\\nlose weight is to find out your other risk factors for heart disease.It is important to know whether you have any of the following:high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol,high triglycerides, high blood glucose (blood sugar), a family historyof heart disease, physical inactivity, or smoking.

In the meantime, if you have highblood pressure or high blood cholesterol, here are some guidelines: \\nBlood Pressure and the DASH Eating Plan\\nIf you have high blood pressure or prehypertension, you may wantto follow an eating plan called DASH. DASH stands for “DietaryApproaches to Stop Hypertension,” and the eating plan emphasizesfruits, vegetables, whole-grain foods, and low-fat milk products.It is rich in magnesium, potassium, calcium, protein, and fiber, butlow in saturated fat, trans fat, total fat, and cholesterol. It limits \\nred meat, sweets, and beverages with added sugars. In many ways,DASH is similar to the TLC eating plan described on pages 53–55.However, the DASH plan also encourages you to eat specific foodsrich in the nutrients noted above.\\nA major study found that people who followed this eating plan\\nreduced their blood pressure more than those who ate more “typical”American diets, which have fewer fruits and vegetables. A secondstudy found that people who followed the DASH eating plan and cut\\ndown on sodium had the biggest reductions in blood pressure. (Salt,or sodium chloride, and other forms of sodium are found in manyprocessed foods. Often, more salt is added to food during cookingand at the table.) So, for a truly winning combination, follow theDASH eating plan and lower your sodium intake as much as possible.The study found that the less sodium people consumed, the moretheir blood pressure dropped. (See ”The DASH Eating Plan” onpages 51–52 and “Please Don’t Pass the Salt” on page 52.) \\nWhile the DASH eating plan is geared especially toward people with\\nhigh blood pressure or prehypertension, it is a healthy plan foreveryone. So share it with your family. When people with normalblood pressure follow the DASH eating plan, especially when theyalso consume less sodium, they lessen their chances of developinghigh blood pressure. Remember, 90 percent of middle-agedAmericans go on to develop high blood pressure. Use the DASHplan to help beat the odds! Your Guide to a Healthy Heart'),\n",

Weight loss can helpcontrol diabetes, as well as reduce high blood pressure and highblood cholesterol.

Successful,\\nlasting weight loss requires a change of lifestyle, not a brief effort to drop pounds quickly. Otherwise, you will probably regain theweight.

If you have a lot of weight to lose, ask your doctor, a registered dietitian, or a qualified nutritionist to help you develop a sensible plan for gradual weight loss.\\nTo take off pounds and keep them off, you will need to make\\nchanges in both your eating and physical activity habits. Weightcontrol is a question of balance. You take in calories from the foods you eat. You burn off calories during physical activity.Cutting down on calories, especially calories from fat, is key to losing weight. Combining this change in diet with a regular physicalactivity program, such as walking or swimming, will help you bothshed pounds and stay trim for the long term.61Taking Charge: An Action Plan for Heart Health'),\n",

Here are some tips to help you succeed:\\nEat for health . Choose a wide variety of low-calorie, nutritious foods\\nin moderate amounts. Include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, andlow-fat or fat-free milk, as well as fish, lean meat, poultry, or drybeans. Choose foods that are low in fat and added sugars. Choosesensible portion sizes. (See “Portion Distortion” on page 68.) \\nWatch calories . To lose weight, most overweight people will need to\\ncut 500 to 1,000 calories per day from their current diet.\\nFor tips on choosing low-fat, low-calorie foods, see “The Substitution\\nSolution” on pages 66–67.\\nKeep milk on the menu . Don’t cut out milk products as you try to\\nreduce calories and fat. Milk and milk products are rich in calcium, a nutrient that helps prevent the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis.Instead, choose low-fat or fat-free milk and milk products, whichhave the same amount of calcium as whole-milk products. Make theswitch gradually. If you are used to drinking whole milk, first cutback to 2 percent, then move to 1 percent, and finally to fat-free milk.\\nKeep moving . Physical activity is key to successful, long-term\\nweight loss. It can help you burn calories, trim extra fat from yourwaist, and control your appetite. It can also tone your muscles andincrease aerobic fitness. To lose weight and to prevent furtherweight gain, gradually build up to at least 60 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of theweek. If you’ve lost weight, in order to keep it off, you’ll need to do even more physical activity—from 60–90 minutes of daily mod-erate-intensity physical activity. But you don’t need to run yourselfragged. A recent study showed that moderate physical activity, suchas brisk walking, helps people lose weight as effectively as more vigorous exercise. For more tips, see “Get Moving!” on page 72.\\nSteer clear of fast food . A single meal from a fast food restaurant\\nmay contain as many calories as you need for a whole day! A recentstudy showed that young adults who eat frequently at fast foodrestaurants gain more weight and are at higher risk for diabetes inmiddle age than those who avoid the fast food habit.

Ask for salad dressings, mayonnaise, and otherhigh-fat condiments to be served on the side—or not at all.\\nKnow about medicines . If you are very overweight, or if you are\\noverweight and have other weight-related risk factors or diseases,your doctor may advise you to take a medicine to help you take offpounds. You should use a weight-loss drug only after you have trieda low-calorie diet, more moderate-intensity physical activity, andother lifestyle changes for 6 months without successfully losingweight. Because weight-loss medicines have side effects, you shouldconsider all of the risks and benefits before trying one of them.These drugs should be used along with a low-calorie eating plan andregular physical activity, not as a substitute for these lifestyle changes.\\nGet support . Tell your family and friends about your weight-loss\\nplans and let them know how they can be most helpful to you.Some people also find it useful to join a structured weight-loss pro-gram. The most effective groups provide support and advice for per-manently changing eating and physical activity habits. (See “HowTo Choose a Weight-Loss Program” on page 70.)\\nLock in your losses . After reaching your weight-loss goal, switch\\nyour efforts to keeping the weight off by continuing to eat a nutri-tious, lower calorie diet and getting regular physical activity. Tomaintain your weight, you’ll need to become even more active thanbefore:  Aim for 60 to 90 minutes of physical activity per day.While this may seem like a tall order, remember that you can countthe activities that you’re already doing.

It’s important to set goals that are specific, achiev-\\nable, and “forgiving” (allow you to be less than perfect).

A great goal! \\nBuild on success . Rather than focusing on one big goal, choose a\\nseries of smaller goals that will bring you closer and closer to yourlarger goal. For example, if one of your big goals is to reduce yourdaily calories from 2,000 to 1,200, first reduce your calories to1,700, then move to 1,400, and finally to 1,200.

Take some time to think about all the benefits \\nof being “smoke free.” Besides the health benefits of quitting, what else do you have to gain? Money saved from not buying cigarettes? Loved ones no longer exposed to secondhand smoke? A better appearance? No more standing outside in the cold or rain for a smoke? Write down all of the reasons you want to stop smoking.\\n■Sign on the dotted line . Write a brief contract that states your \\nintention to stop smoking, your quitting date, and some ways you plan to reward yourself for becoming an exsmoker. Have someone sign it with you.\\n■Lineup support . Ask the person who cosigns your contract—or\\nanother friend or relative—to give you special support in your efforts to quit. Plan to get in touch with your support person regularly to share your progress and to get encouragement. If possible, quit with a friend or family member.\\nBreaking the Habit\\n■Know yourself . To quit successfully, you need to know your \\npersonal smoking “triggers.” These are the situations and feelings that typically bring on the urge to light up. Some common triggers are drinking coffee, having an alcoholic drink, talking on the phone, watching someone else smoke, and experiencing stress. Make a list of your own personal triggers.Especially during the first weeks after quitting, try to avoid as many triggers as you can.\\n■Find new habits . Replace your “triggers” with new activities \\nthat you don’t associate with smoking. For example, if you’ve always had a cigarette with a cup of coffee, switch to tea for a while. If stress is a trigger for you, try a relaxation exercise such as deep breathing to calm yourself. (Take a slow, deep breath, count to five, and release it. Repeat 10 times.) \\n■Keep busy . Get involved in activities that require you to use your\\nhands, such as needlework, art projects, jigsaw puzzles, or fix-upprojects around your house or apartment. When you feel the urge to put something in your mouth, try some vegetable sticks, apple slices, or sugarless gum. Some people find it helpful to \\ninhale on a straw or chew on a toothpick until the urge passes.\\n■Keep moving . Walk, garden, bike, or do some yoga stretches.\\nPhysical activity will make you feel better and will help prevent weight gain.'),\n",

During the first few weeks after quitting,\\nyou may experience temporary withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, irritability, tiredness, and trouble concentrating.While these feelings are not pleasant, it may help to know that they are signs that your body is recovering from smoking. Mostsymptoms end within 2 to 4 weeks.\\n■Ask for help . A number of free or low-cost programs are avail-\\nable to help people stop smoking. They include programs offered by local chapters of the American Lung Association andthe American Cancer Society. Other low-cost programs can be found through hospitals, health maintenance organizations, workplaces, and community groups.\\n■Give yourself a break . Get plenty of rest, drink lots of water, \\nand eat three healthy meals each day. If you are not as productive\\nor cheerful as usual during the first weeks after quitting, be gentle with yourself. Give yourself a chance to adjust to your new smoke-free lifestyle. Congratulate yourself for making a major, positive change in your life.\\nMore Help forQuitting\\nAs you prepare to quit smoking, consider using a medicine that\\ncan help you stay off cigarettes. Some of these medicationscontain very small amounts of nicotine, which can help lessenthe urge to smoke. They include nicotine gum (available over-thecounter), the nicotine patch (available over the counter and byprescription), a nicotine inhaler (by prescription only), and a nico-tine nasal spray (by prescription only). Another quitting aid isBupropion SR, a medicine that contains no nicotine but reducesthe craving for cigarettes. It is available only by prescription.While all of these medications can help people stop smoking,they are not safe for everyone. Talk with your doctor aboutwhether you should try any of these aids. \\nHelp for Quitting'),\n",

But most exsmokers gain less than 10pounds. Weight gain may be partly due to changes in the waythe body uses calories after smoking stops. Some people alsomay gain weight because they substitute high-calorie foods forcigarettes.

Most smokers slip three to five times beforethey quit for good. To get right back on the nonsmoking track:\\n■Don’t be discouraged . Having a cigarette doesn’t mean you \\ncan’t quit smoking. A slip happens to many people who successfully quit. Keep thinking of yourself as a nonsmoker.(You are one.)\\n■Learn from experience . What was the “trigger” that made you \\nlight up? Were you driving home from work, enjoying a glass of wine at a party, feeling angry with your boss? Think back on the day’s events until you remember what the trigger was.\\n■Take charge .

We now know thattwo-thirds of teenagers have at least one risk factor for heart dis-ease, from overweight and “couch potato-itis” to unhealthy bloodpressure and cholesterol levels. Even more disturbing, about onemillion U.S. teenagers have metabolic syndrome, which is a clusterof risk factors that greatly increases the risk of a later heart attack.We owe it to our children and grandchildren to help them developheart healthy habits—and the earlier the better. Here are some waysto begin:\\nSet a good example . Adults have a big influence on children’s and\\nteens’ behavior—even though kids may not want to admit it. If youfollow a healthy lifestyle, the younger members of your family will be\\nmore likely to do the same. Let them see you eat-\\ning nutritious snacks and enjoying outdoor\\nactivities, and invite them to join in. If you\\nsmoke, stop—and tell your kids and grand-\\nkids why you’re quitting.\\nWhat’s cookin’? Fully 80 percent of\\nchildren eat fewer than five serv-\\nings of fruits and vegetables per\\nday. What to do? Practice\\n“stealth cooking”—creating\\nhealthy meals for kids that will\\nstill make their mouths water.

For dessert, skip the ice\\ncream and offer fresh fruit, fig bars, ginger snaps, graham crackers,or frozen fat-free dairy desserts.\\nRaise “kitchen kids.” Most children enjoy cooking when it’s pre-\\nsented as an easy, fun activity. Show young kids how to clean fruitsand veggies and combine them into colorful salads. Let them make“fruit-salad faces” out of sliced apples, bananas, and raisins. Whenthey’re old enough, teach children to use the stove, oven, microwave,and toaster safely. Show teens how to make simple, healthy dishes,such as whole-grain pasta with vegetables and broiled chicken orfish. Encourage them to be creative with herbs and spices. Childrenwho have basic kitchen skills appreciate food more and are morelikely to try new dishes.\\nGet them moving . The latest “Dietary Guidelines for Americans”\\nrecommend that children and teenagers be physically active for atleast 60 minutes per day. Yet, in a world chock full of video games,TV shows, and computer offerings, few young people are as activeas they should be. To encourage children to get off the couch, findout what kinds of physical activities they do enjoy and make it easyfor them to participate. If the kids in your family like to ride bikes,plan a Sunday outing on your local trail. Walk, cycle, or jog withthem to places close by. Use your backyard or local park to toss aFrisbee around or to play a game of basketball, badminton, or vol-leyball. Make an effort to gear activities to children’s ages. Youngerkids, up to age 10, tend to have quick bursts of energy sandwichedbetween longer periods of rest, while older children usually have\\nmore endurance.
